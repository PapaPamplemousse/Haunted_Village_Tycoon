# 🕯️ Haunted Village Tycoon

### *Banquet or Bloodletting — your bylaws decide.*

**Genre:** Colony Management • Horror Simulation • Dark Humor
**Engine:** Currently [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com) • Future migration to [ChaosEngine](https://github.com/PapaPamplemousse/ChaosEngine)

## 🧱 Overview

**Haunted Village Tycoon** is a **darkly humorous colony simulator** where you play as the mayor of a cursed settlement struggling to survive — and stay sane — under an encroaching supernatural blight.

Build, govern, preach, and punish as your people’s faith, fear, and hunger intertwine. The horror here isn’t in monsters… it’s in **the system itself.**

## ⚙️ Current Development

This repository hosts the **prototype implementation**, built using the **[Raylib](https://www.raylib.com)** framework for rapid iteration.

Core systems currently under development include:

* **Procedural World Generation**
* **Tile, Object, and Biome Systems**
* **Entity and Building Detection**
* **Basic AI (Villager & Creature Movement)**
* **Camera and UI Framework**

> 💡 Future versions will migrate to a custom engine — **[ChaosEngine](https://github.com/PapaPamplemousse/ChaosEngine)** — an in-house C/C++ engine developed by the same author for high-performance simulation and modular architecture.

## 🌍 Design Philosophy

> “The horror isn’t in the night — it’s in your policies.”

The design follows four main pillars, from the full **[Game Design Document (GDD)](./Haunted_Village_Tycoon_GDD.pdf):**

1. **Stewardship Under a Curse** – Grow, protect, and civilize while the land and minds rot.
2. **Society as a System** – Every vice, virtue, and law interacts; no two towns fall the same way.
3. **The Horror is Systemic** – Hunger breeds theft → riots → cults → cannibalism.
4. **Legacy, Not Leveling** – Progress through culture, faith, and bloodlines — not stats.

## 🔮 Planned Core Features

* **Faith & Fear System** — Dynamic tension between religion, rationalism, and occultism.
* **Food & Famine Simulation** — Cannibalism emerges naturally under scarcity.
* **Cult Networks & Rituals** — Secret cells form under neglect and corruption.
* **Deathcare & Hauntings** — Improper burials lead to spirits, grief, and unrest.
* **Dynasty & Heir System** — Succession defines the tone of each generation.
* **Dark Humor UI** — Sarcastic advisors, ironic tooltips, and ledger notes dripping with wit.

---

## 🧠 Technical Vision

* **Engine Migration:** From Raylib to **ChaosEngine**, a modular and extensible C framework.
* **Data-Driven Design:** All content defined in human-readable YAML/JSON (tiles, edicts, events).
* **Deterministic Simulation:** Fixed-step tick scheduler for AI, events, and systemic decay.
* **Mod-Friendly Architecture:** Seamless content injection through additive patches.

## 🕯️ Vision Statement

> *“Haunted Village Tycoon” aims to fuse the strategic tension of RimWorld, the moral decay of Frostpunk, and the deadpan wit of Darkest Dungeon — all within a systemic sandbox where your laws are your legacy.*
